5.1.1.1.1	Living things are both similar to and different from each other and from nonliving things.
5.1.1.1.2	The world around us is made up of both living and nonliving things.
5.1.1.1.3	Living things depend upon each other and the nonliving environment to survive.
5.1.1.2.1	Animals and plants are living things.
5.1.1.2.2	They have basic needs (necessities) in order to survive.
5.1.1.2.3	We often say that living things (organisms) are alive.
5.1.1.1.1.1	Animals need air, water, and food to live and survive.
5.1.1.1.2.1	Animals take in air by breathing.
5.1.1.1.2.2	They need oxygen, which is in the air.
5.1.1.1.2.3	Oxygen allows the animal to make and use energy, which it needs to survive.
5.1.1.1.3.1	Animals also need water to survive.
5.1.1.1.3.2	Water is used to break down and move materials throughout the body.
5.1.1.1.4.1	Animals cannot make their own food so they must eat to get nutrients.
5.1.1.1.4.2	Nutrients are necessary for growth and energy.
5.1.1.1.5.1	Plants need air, water, nutrients, and light to live and survive.
5.1.1.1.6.1	Plants take in air through their leaves.
5.1.1.1.6.2	The type of air that plants take in and use is carbon dioxide.
5.1.1.1.6.3	This is necessary for the plant to create food.
5.1.1.1.6.4	Plants make their own food by a process called photosynthesis.
5.1.1.1.7.1	Water is used by the plant to move materials up from the roots to make food.
5.1.1.1.8.1	Nutrients from the soil enter the plant through its roots.
5.1.1.1.8.2	Nutrients are necessary for the plant to survive.
5.1.1.1.9.1	Light is one of the most important things for a plant.
5.1.1.1.9.2	Light gives the plant the energy it needs to survive.
5.1.1.1.10.1	If the living organism does not get the air, water, food, nutrients, or light it needs to survive it will die.
5.1.1.2.1.1	Nonliving things are all around us.
5.1.1.2.1.2	They are present in nature or can be made by humans.
5.1.1.2.1.3	They do not have a life cycle.
5.1.1.2.2.1	A rock is considered a nonliving thing.
5.1.1.2.2.2	It exists in nature.
5.1.1.2.2.3	A nonliving thing does not need anything to exist.
5.1.1.2.2.4	It does not grow or reproduce and it is not alive.
5.1.1.2.3.1	A swing set is a nonliving thing that is man-made.
5.1.1.2.3.2	Your desk, pencil, and paper are all nonliving things.
5.1.1.2.3.3	They were made by humans but cannot change or grow on their own.
5.1.1.2.3.4	Air and water are nonliving but are necessary for living things to live and survive.
5.1.1.3.1.1	All living things are able to go through certain life processes.
5.1.1.3.2.1	They can grow, take in nutrients, breathe, reproduce, eliminate waste, and die.
5.1.1.3.2.2	These life processes are also known as the requirements for life.
5.1.1.3.1.1.1	Most animals are born as a smaller version of what an adult looks like.
5.1.1.3.1.1.2	As they grow their bones get longer and bigger, they grow more hair, and are able to take care of themselves by getting food, shelter, and water.
5.1.1.3.1.1.3	All living things grow and have a life cycle.
5.1.1.3.1.2.1	Some animals are born as one type of organism and as they grow they go into a changing stage called metamorphosis.
5.1.1.3.1.2.2	Tadpoles change into frogs, caterpillars change into butterflies, and mealworms turn into beetles.
5.1.1.3.1.2.3	This is their way of growing and changing.
5.1.1.3.1.3.1	Plants can grow from a seed into a flower, tree, or bush.
5.1.1.3.1.3.2	Plants reproduce by producing flowers and fruits that have seeds.
5.1.1.3.1.3.3	The seeds then grow into plants.
5.1.1.3.1.3.4	Other plants develop outgrowths that can grow into adult plants.
5.1.1.3.2.1.1	All living things need nutrients to survive.
5.1.1.3.2.1.2	Animals take in food as a nutrient to give them energy and help them grow.
5.1.1.3.2.1.3	Plants get their nutrients from the soil, which helps them grow and perform photosynthesis.
5.1.1.3.2.1.4	Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food.
5.1.1.3.3.1.1	All living things do some type of breathing.
5.1.1.3.3.1.2	Most animals take in oxygen through their mouths.
5.1.1.3.3.1.3	Fish breathe through gills.
5.1.1.3.3.1.4	Both inhale (take in) oxygen, which is used to create energy.
5.1.1.3.3.1.5	Oxygen is found in the air all around us.
5.1.1.3.3.1.6	Animals exhale (give off) carbon dioxide, which is used by plants.
5.1.1.3.3.1.7	Plants take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen.
5.1.1.3.4.1.1	All living things are able to produce offspring.
5.1.1.3.4.1.2	We usually call them babies.
5.1.1.3.4.1.3	Some offspring are born looking like their parents.
5.1.1.3.4.2.1	Some offspring are born as one form and change over time into an adult form.
5.1.1.3.5.1.1	All living things must be able to get rid of the solid waste that they produce.
5.1.1.3.5.1.2	Animals take in food to get nutrients.
5.1.1.3.5.1.3	After their bodies have used the nutritious parts of the food they must get rid of the leftover material that they cannot use.
5.1.1.3.5.1.4	All animals get rid of this solid waste after passing food through their digestive system.
5.1.1.3.5.1.5	The waste leaves the body in the form of feces.
5.1.1.3.5.1.6	This waste, when mixed into the soil, can be very helpful to growing plants.
5.1.1.3.5.2.1	Animals get rid of their gaseous waste by exhaling carbon dioxide through their mouth and nose.
5.1.1.3.5.2.2	Plants get rid of chemical waste through their roots.
5.1.1.3.5.2.3	Plants get rid of gaseous waste through their leaves in the form of oxygen.
5.1.2.1.1	Plants are living organisms.
5.1.2.1.2	Plants require air, water, nutrients, and light in order to live and survive.
5.1.2.2.1	Plants contain little green particles called chloroplasts, which are made up of chlorophyll.
5.1.2.2.2	Plants are the only living organism that can make its own food.
5.1.2.2.3	Chlorophyll is used for photosynthesis, the process by which plants make food.
5.1.2.3.1	Other living organisms depend on plants to survive.
5.1.2.4.1	Plants provide animals with food and gases (oxygen) that their bodies need to grow, breathe, and make energy.
5.1.2.1.1.1	Photosynthesis is a process by which plants make their own food and give off oxygen and water that they are not using.
5.1.2.1.1.2	The food made by the plant is a form of sugar called glucose.
5.1.2.1.1.3	Oxygen is a gas that is needed by many animals in order to survive.
5.1.2.1.1.4	Humans inhale (breathe in) oxygen and exhale (breathe out) carbon dioxide.
5.1.2.1.2.1	The leaves of the plants take in carbon dioxide from the environment.
5.1.2.1.2.2	They give off oxygen, which animals need to survive.
5.1.2.1.3.1	Water is taken in from the environment through the roots in the ground and is necessary for the plant to produce food.
5.1.2.1.4.1	Nutrients are taken in through the roots from the soil and help the plant survive.
5.1.2.1.5.1	Light is provided by the sun.
5.1.2.1.5.2	It is absorbed (taken in) by the leaves and is necessary for the plant to produce food.
5.1.2.1.5.3	Light provides the energy for the entire process of photosynthesis.
5.1.2.2.1.1	There are four major parts of a plant: roots, stem, leaves, and flower.
5.1.2.2.2.1	Each part of a plant has a specific job (function).
5.1.2.2.3.1	Roots grow underground.
5.1.2.2.3.2	Roots anchor the plant in the soil.
5.1.2.2.3.3	Roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil into the plant.
5.1.2.2.4.1	Stem, stalk, or trunk - extends from the roots up to the leaves and flower
5.1.2.2.5.1	The stem is the pathway of water and nutrients from roots to leaves and flower.
5.1.2.2.6.1	The stem supports and holds up the plant.
5.1.2.2.7.1	The stem is the pathway for transporting (carrying) water and nutrients.
5.1.2.2.8.1	The stem transports extra food (glucose) made in the leaves to the roots to be stored for later use.
5.1.2.2.9.1	Leaves extend from the stem.
5.1.2.2.10.1	Leaves are the food-making factory of the plant.
5.1.2.2.11.1	Leaves make food using water, sunlight, nutrients, and chlorophyll.
5.1.2.2.12.1	The flower is found atop the stem or stalk.
5.1.2.2.13.1	The flower is responsible for reproduction.
5.1.2.2.14.1	With the help of animals (insects and birds), rain, and wind, flowers can be pollinated (fertilized ) so that seeds can be formed that will grow into new plants.
5.1.2.3.1.1	The flower is the reproductive part of the plant.
5.1.2.3.1.2	Flowers are usually bright colors and have nice scents for a reason.
5.1.2.3.1.3	These colors and smells attract birds and insects to visit them and help with the reproduction process.
5.1.2.3.2.1	In the flower there are male and female reproductive parts.
5.1.2.3.3.1	The male organ of the flower is called the stamen (containing pollen).
5.1.2.3.4.1	The female organ of the flower is called the pistil (containing eggs).
5.1.2.3.5.1	When plants reproduce, the offspring has characteristics similar to the parents.
5.1.2.3.5.2	Seeds are formed when cells from the male and female parts of the plant combine.
5.1.2.3.5.3	Seeds grow in the center of a flower and continue to develop there after the petals fall off the plant.
5.1.2.3.5.4	If the seed surroundings swell up they can form a fruit.
5.1.2.3.5.5	All fruits have seeds.
5.1.2.3.5.6	Some have one big seed, called the pit, like a peach.
5.1.2.3.5.7	Some fruits have a few seeds, like an apple.
5.1.2.3.5.8	Some fruits have many little seeds, like a kiwi.
5.1.2.3.6.1	Seeds can be spread out or dispersed by the plant itself.
5.1.2.3.6.2	The seeds can also be distributed in a variety of ways that can include wind, water, and animals.
5.1.2.3.7.1	Seeds contain stored food that aids in germination (sprouting) and the growth of new young plants.
5.1.2.4.1.1	Adaptation is an organism's ability to adjust to its surroundings.
5.1.2.4.1.2	Some plant adaptations might include:
5.1.2.4.2.1	Thorns on stems to protect the plant from being eaten
5.1.2.4.3.1	Large leaves to increase surface area for photosynthesis
5.1.2.4.4.1	Colored or patterned leaves and/or flowers in order to blend into the environment
5.1.2.4.5.1	Roots grow longer to reach the water supply.
5.1.2.4.6.1	Leaves and stems develop tough outer coatings to protect the plant from the environment.
5.1.2.4.7.1	Stems become thicker to prevent water loss.
5.1.2.5.1.1	Plants have life cycles that may include beginning of life, development into an adult, reproduction as an adult, and eventually death.
5.1.2.5.1.2	The length of time from the beginning of the plant to its death is called its life span.
5.1.2.5.1.3	Each kind of plant goes through its own stages of growth and development, which includes seed, young plant (or seedling), and mature plant.
5.1.2.5.2.1	Growth is the process by which plants increase in size.
5.1.3.1.1	Animals are living organisms.
5.1.3.1.2	Animals require air, water, and food in order to live and survive.
5.1.3.1.3	All animals grow, take in nutrients, breathe, reproduce, eliminate waste, and die.
5.1.3.1.4	Each animal has different structures that serve different functions for growth, survival, and reproduction.
5.1.3.1.1.1	All animals are made up of cells that have specific functions (jobs).
5.1.3.1.1.2	Groups of cells make up tissues.
5.1.3.1.1.3	Muscles and skin are examples of tissues.
5.1.3.1.1.4	Groups of tissues working together are called organs.
5.1.3.1.1.5	The lungs are an organ in the body.
5.1.3.1.1.6	Different organs working together are called organ systems.
5.1.3.1.1.7	These organ systems work together to make up the organism.
5.1.3.1.2.1	Each organ system has a specific function that helps the organism to survive.
5.1.3.1.2.2	The body systems work like a machine and each system works to help the animal grow, create energy, and survive.
5.1.3.2.1.1.1	All animals need to take in food, water, and nutrients (vitamins and minerals) to survive.
5.1.3.2.1.1.2	They take food into their mouth, where the teeth and tongue break up the food into smaller pieces so t hat it can be swallowed.
5.1.3.2.1.1.3	The food then goes through a tube called the esophagus to the stomach where it is broken down more.
5.1.3.2.1.1.4	The digested food then moves into the intestine where the nutrients are absorbed into the blood.
5.1.3.2.1.1.5	Any undigested food exits the body as feces through the anus.
5.1.3.2.1.2.1	During ingestion food is taken into the body.
5.1.3.2.1.3.1	During digestion nutrients are taken into the body.
5.1.3.2.1.4.1	During egestion undigested food leaves the body.
5.1.3.2.2.1.1	All animals need to take in oxygen in order to survive.
5.1.3.2.2.1.2	We do this by breathing.
5.1.3.2.2.1.3	Animals take in air, which contains oxygen, through the nose.
5.1.3.2.2.1.4	After we inhale the air it moves through a tube called the trachea to the lungs.
5.1.3.2.2.1.5	In the lungs, the oxygen enters the blood so that the oxygen is carried throughout the body.
5.1.3.2.2.1.6	All cells need oxygen to survive.
5.1.3.2.2.1.7	After the cells use the oxygen the blood carries the waste, carbon dioxide, back to the lungs.
5.1.3.2.2.1.8	The lungs send the carbon dioxide out of the body when we exhale.
5.1.3.2.2.1.9	The diaphragm is a muscle that moves up and down as we inhale and exhale and helps the lungs take in and let out air.
5.1.3.2.3.1.1	The body must get nutrients and oxygen to all of its cells, tissues, and organs.
5.1.3.2.3.1.2	It does this by circulating blood throughout the body.
5.1.3.2.3.1.3	The blood carries the nutrients through tubes called vessels.
5.1.3.2.3.1.4	The blood is circulated (carried) all over the body because of a strong muscle that continuously pumps the blood called the heart.
5.1.3.2.3.2.1	When you put your fingertips against the inside of your wrist you can feel the blood pulsing through your vessels.
5.1.3.2.4.1.1	After the blood carries nutrients and oxygen throughout the body we need to get rid of the chemical waste.
5.1.3.2.4.1.2	The blood takes the chemical waste and excess water to the kidneys where it is collected and sent to the bladder until the body excretes it as urine.
5.1.3.2.5.1.1	Animals need to move around to find shelter and food.
5.1.3.2.5.1.2	They do this by moving muscles and bones.
5.1.3.2.5.1.3	The skeleton provides support and protects the body's organs.
5.1.3.2.6.1.1	All animals need to sense their surroundings, respond to environmental changes, know where and how to find food, care for their young, and many other things.
5.1.3.2.6.1.2	They do all of this with their brain and nerves.
5.1.3.2.6.2.1	Humans have five senses: taste, touch, smell, sight, and hearing.
5.1.3.2.6.2.2	The senses tell the organism all that is happening around them.
5.1.3.2.6.3.1	We hear with our ears.
5.1.3.2.6.3.2	The vibrations from sound move tiny bones in our ears which send a message through the auditory nerve to the brain so that we understand what is being heard.
5.1.3.2.6.4.1	We taste with our tongue.
5.1.3.2.6.4.2	There are tiny sensors on the tongue called taste buds that identify different tastes such as sweet, sour, bitter, and tart.
5.1.3.2.6.4.3	The taste buds send information to the brain so that we can decide if we like or dislike the taste.
5.1.3.2.6.5.1	We see with our eyes.
5.1.3.2.6.5.2	The eyes take in light through the lenses and transmit the shapes and images through the optic nerve to the brain.
5.1.3.2.6.6.1	We touch with our fingers and skin.
5.1.3.2.6.6.2	All over the skin there are tiny spots that feel things and transmit texture, temperature, and other characteristics to the brain by way of the nerves.
5.1.3.2.6.7.1	We smell with our nose.
5.1.3.2.6.7.2	Tiny hairs and nerves in our nose sense different smells and send them to the brain so that we can decide if it is a familiar scent or a new one.
5.1.3.3.1.1	All animals have different structures that have different jobs or functions to help with growth, survival, and reproduction.
5.1.3.3.2.1	Animals have different ways of movement.
5.1.3.3.2.2	Birds use their wings, fish use their fins, and others use their legs.
5.1.3.3.2.3	Animals need to move so that they can find a safe place for shelter, find food, and escape predators (enemies).
5.1.3.3.3.1	Lobsters and crabs protect themselves with their claws, turtles have shells, porcupines have spines, birds use their feathers, and others have fur or scales to help protect them from predators.
5.1.3.3.4.1	Some animals are able to change the color of their body covering to that of their surroundings.
5.1.3.3.4.2	We call this camouflage, which helps protect the animal from enemies.
5.1.3.3.4.3	Think of a lion's golden fur, which helps it blend into the desert landscape.
5.1.3.3.4.4	Chameleons are lizards that can change colors based on the color of their surroundings.
5.1.3.3.4.5	On the sand it will turn a tan color and on grass it will turn green to allow it to hide from predators.
5.1.3.3.5.1	Some animals protect themselves by sending o ut special sounds or smells, which is another type of defense mechanism.
5.1.3.3.5.2	These smells and sounds can attract other animals so that they can mate or they can help them fight an enemy.
5.1.3.3.5.3	Skunks are able to give off a very foul smell when in danger.
5.1.3.3.5.4	This is how they protect themselves.
5.1.3.4.1.1	Behavior is the way that organisms respond to changes in their environment or to a stimulus.
5.1.3.4.2.1	Humans shiver when it is cold and by doing so we create more heat in an attempt to warm our bodies.
5.1.3.4.2.2	In the hot weather our bodies sweat (perspiration), bringing water to our skin.
5.1.3.4.2.3	When air brushes across our wet skin, it cools down our body.
5.1.3.4.3.1	When we get nervous, scared, or upset our body responds by increasing our heart rate.
5.1.3.4.3.2	We breathe faster and begin to sweat.
5.1.3.4.3.3	This is how our body prepares itself for whatever danger may be coming.
5.1.3.4.1.1.1	Some animal behaviors are influenced by environmental conditions.
5.1.3.4.1.1.2	These behaviors may include: nest building, hibernating, hunting, migrating, and communicating.
5.1.3.4.1.2.1	Many animals are able to change their body with the seasons.
5.1.3.4.1.2.2	We wear winter coats, gloves, and hats when the weather is cold.
5.1.3.4.1.2.3	Some animals grow thicker fur in the winter and shed it in the warmer months.
5.1.3.4.1.2.4	This helps to regulate their body heat.
5.1.3.4.1.2.5	Other animals change their amount of body fat with the seasons.
5.1.3.4.1.2.6	Body fat is a form of stored energy and helps animals get through long periods of time with little food.
5.1.3.4.1.2.7	Some animals gather food in preparation for the long winter.
5.1.3.4.1.2.8	Squirrels collect acorns.
5.1.3.4.1.3.1	Some animals live a very different life in the warm weather than in the cold weather.
5.1.3.4.1.3.2	Some animals hibernate during the winter months.
5.1.3.4.1.3.3	Their bodies slow down and go into a dormant (inactive) state.
5.1.3.4.1.3.4	Bears hibernate but before doing so they eat a great deal of food to increase their body fat.
5.1.3.4.1.3.5	They are able to go for a long period of time with little food and will sleep until the cold winter months pass.
5.1.3.4.1.4.1	Moving to a warmer climate in the cold months is another way some animals deal with changes in the weather.
5.1.3.4.1.4.2	This is called migration.
5.1.3.4.1.4.3	Birds are known for fly ing south in the winter to avoid the cold months.
5.1.3.5.1.1	Individual organisms and species change over long periods of time.
5.1.3.5.1.2	These changes (adaptations) depend on the environment.
5.1.3.5.1.3	Adaptations are passed from one generation to the next so that the species can survive and thrive.
5.1.3.5.1.4	The saying, "survival of the fittest", means that those who are best adapted will survive over those who are not.
5.1.3.5.2.1	One example of how organisms have adapted to their environment is the fish.
5.1.3.5.2.2	Because fish live in the water and need to breathe, they developed gills.
5.1.3.5.2.3	Gills are slits in the sides of their body that allow the fish to get oxygen from the water while swimming.
5.1.3.5.3.1	Camels are able to go for long periods of time with little water.
5.1.3.5.3.2	This makes them the best type of animal to live in the desert.
5.1.3.5.3.3	Cactus plants can also go for long periods of time with little water, which is why they survive in the desert.
5.1.3.5.4.1	Look at the similarities and differences between animals' arms and/or wings.
5.1.3.5.4.2	Depending on how the organism lives, their arm and/or wing adapted to help it survive.
5.1.3.5.5.1	A bird's beak functions like human lips and teeth.
5.1.3.5.5.2	A beak helps the bird capture and take in food.
5.1.3.5.5.3	Compare the various beaks shown below and think about what type of food each bird eats.
5.1.3.5.5.4	The shape, strength, and design of the beak varies depending on whether it is a bird of prey, a seed-eater, or a fish-eater.
5.1.3.5.6.1	Elephants have long trunks that enable them to grab food and drink water.
5.1.3.5.6.2	They also have very large ear flaps that help them hear.
5.1.3.5.6.3	Because of their size, elephants move very slowly, so having good hearing helps protect them from predators.
5.1.3.5.7.1	All organisms have variations, and because of these variations, individuals of a species may have an advantage in surviving and reproducing.
5.1.3.5.7.2	Diversity is the many different types of animals within the same species.
5.1.3.5.7.3	There are many different breeds of dogs but there are variations with in the same breed.
5.1.3.5.7.4	You could have three beagles that look similar but their markings are different.
5.1.3.6.1.1	All living things go through different stages in its life.
5.1.3.6.1.2	They are born, grow (develop), have babies (offspring), and die.
5.1.3.6.1.3	This is called the continuity of life or life cycle.
5.1.3.6.1.4	When an organism has an offspring (baby) it is called reproduction.
5.1.3.6.1.5	As they grow and change over time it is called development.
5.1.3.6.2.1	Living things must reproduce and have babies so that their species will continue.
5.1.3.6.2.2	If they are not able to reproduce, their species will become extinct.
5.1.3.6.2.3	Extinction is when the species no longer exists, such as the dinosaurs.
5.1.3.6.3.1	All living things have specific patterns of reproduction, growth, and development that are called stages in its life cycle.
5.1.3.6.4.1	Life cycle stages go in a certain order and occur throughout the life span of the organism.
5.1.3.6.4.2	The characteristics of the cycle of life vary from organism to organism.
5.1.3.6.4.3	You may have had a pet or witnessed some of the following organisms' life cycles.
5.1.3.6.5.1	Some animals are born as one type of organism and as they grow they go into a changing stage called metamorphosis.
5.1.3.6.5.2	Some examples are the frog, beetle, and ladybug.
5.1.3.6.6.1	The length of time from an animal's birth to its death is called its life span.
5.1.3.6.6.2	The type of environment they live in and various environment al factors can have a direct effect on organisms.
5.1.3.6.6.3	Life spans of different animals vary.
5.1.3.6.7.1	The average life span of a fruit fly is 72 hours.
5.1.3.6.8.1	The average life span of a worker ant is 6 months.
5.1.3.6.9.1	The average life span of a worker bee is 1 year.
5.1.3.6.10.1	The average life span of a rabbit is 9 years.
5.1.3.6.11.1	The average life span of a frog is 10 years.
5.1.3.6.12.1	The average life span of an elephant is 70 years.
5.1.3.6.13.1	The average life span of a human is 79 years.
5.1.3.6.14.1	The average life span of an Amazon parrot is 80 years.
5.1.3.6.15.1	The average life span of a turtle is 100 years.
5.1.3.6.16.1	The health, growth, and development of organisms are affected by environmental conditions such as the availability of food, air, water, space, shelter, heat, and sunlight.
5.1.3.6.17.1	Growth is the process by which plants and animals increase in size.
5.1.3.6.17.2	All living things are constantly going through some form of growth and repair.
5.1.3.6.17.3	When young the overall body is growing and developing.
5.1.3.6.17.4	This is evident by how tall or big the organism grows.
5.1.3.6.17.5	As an organism moves into an adult stage of life they continue to grow.
5.1.3.6.17.6	This is proven by how their hair and nails continue to grow and need to be maintained.
5.1.3.6.17.7	When an animal breaks a bone it is able to heal over time.
5.1.3.6.17.8	This healing is done by the body growing new bone cells to repair the break.
5.1.3.6.18.1	Think about when you may have cut yourself and after a short period of time the cut healed.
5.1.3.6.18.2	Usually your body can heal from a cut without any scar remaining.
5.1.3.6.18.3	This happens because your body is always growing and making new skin cells.
5.1.4.1.1	Have you ever noticed that some children look like their parents and some may also look like their grandparents?
5.1.4.1.2	How does this happen?
5.1.4.2.1	All living things get the information their body needs from their parents.
5.1.4.2.2	This information is called traits.
5.1.4.2.3	A trait could be the color of your hair, skin, and eyes, your height, and the shape of your face, ears, and nose.
5.1.4.2.4	These are all characteristics (traits) that you are born with.
5.1.4.2.5	When a trait is passed from parent to child we say that it is inherited.
5.1.4.2.6	Inheritance is passing characteristics from parent to child.
5.1.4.3.1	Genetics is the branch of science that studies how hereditary information is passed from one generation to the next generation in a family.
5.1.4.1.1.1	A family tree is a chart that shows a family's relatives over time.
5.1.4.1.1.2	In the family tree chart shown below, the grandparents are the first generation, the parents are the second generation, and the children are the third generation.
5.1.4.1.2.1	A pedigree chart shows each level of a family tree in a chart format.
5.1.4.1.2.2	Lines and boxes connect parents and children from one level to the next, as shown below.
5.1.4.1.3.1	Gregor Mendel was a scientist who is known as "the father of genetics."
5.1.4.1.3.2	Mendel researched how pea plants pass on their traits from one generation of plant to the next.
5.1.4.1.3.3	Inherited traits for a plant are flower color, leaf shape, seed shape and color, and overall plant height.
5.1.4.2.1.1	Organisms reproduce an equal amount of genetic information (DNA) from the mother and father.
5.1.4.2.1.2	This information is combined to form the new offspring.
5.1.4.3.1.1	Traits are carried on structures called genes.
5.1.4.3.1.2	Genes are found in all cells.
5.1.4.3.1.3	Genetic information is organized on very tiny structures in the cell called DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid).
5.1.4.3.1.4	DNA is a bundle of chemicals that are considered the map for all living things.
5.1.4.3.1.5	Every organism's DNA is different.
5.1.4.3.1.6	Just as you have your own fingerprint, you also have your own DNA.
5.1.4.3.1.7	DNA tells all living things what it should look like.
5.1.4.3.2.1	DNA looks like a twisted ladder.
5.1.4.3.2.2	Each step of the ladder controls different traits.
5.1.4.3.2.3	Each strand of DNA contains hundreds of pieces of information.
5.1.4.3.2.4	There are many strands of DNA in our body.
5.1.4.3.2.5	The number of DNA strands (chromosomes ) an organism has is the same for all members of a species.
5.1.4.3.2.6	For example, humans have 46 chromosomes and a fruit fly has only 8 chromosomes.
5.1.4.3.3.1	Many organisms look very similar to other organisms because they may be from the same species.
5.1.4.3.3.2	When organisms are of the same species they can mate and produce an offspring like themselves.
5.1.4.3.4.1	A child or baby is called an offspring.
5.1.4.3.4.2	An offspring grows up to look like its parents.
5.1.4.3.4.3	Plants and animals closely resemble their parents and other individuals in their species because of their DNA.
5.1.4.3.5.1	Animals reproduce their own kind.
5.1.4.3.5.2	They may have different markings but you can tell that they are related.
5.1.4.3.6.1	rabbits have rabbits.
5.1.4.3.7.1	cats have kittens.
5.1.4.3.8.1	goldfish have guppies.
5.1.4.3.9.1	frogs have tadpoles.
5.1.4.3.10.1	dogs have puppies.
5.1.4.3.11.1	An organism can only have an offspring from their own species.
5.1.4.3.11.2	Dogs cannot have kittens and rabbits cannot have guppies.
5.1.4.4.1.1	Some characteristics come from living in the environment and cannot be inherited by the next generation.
5.1.4.4.1.2	For example, if you fall and get a deep cut that leaves a scar, you would not pass the scar to your offspring.
5.1.4.4.2.1	Do you know how to jump rope, ride a bike, tap dance, read, play an instrument, or sing?
5.1.4.4.2.2	These are not traits from your parents.
5.1.4.4.2.3	These are called learned or acquired behaviors.
5.1.4.4.2.4	You cannot pass these traits to your offspring through your genes.
5.1.4.4.2.5	You could teach them how to do each behavior but they are not born knowing how to do them.
5.1.5.1.1	Your body is like a very delicate machine that needs to be cared for to work and feel its best.
5.1.5.1.2	In order for humans to grow, have energy, and be healthy they need to eat healthy foods, exercise, and get regular rest.
5.1.5.2.1	Being healthy also includes good health habits.
5.1.5.2.2	Hand washing and personal cleanliness are necessary to prevent disease and infection.
5.1.5.3.1	There are many germs that can be transmitted from touching things and then placing your hands by your face.
5.1.5.3.2	This is why you need to wash your hands often to remove any harmful germs.
5.1.5.3.3	The body needs to be cleaned regularly to prevent germs and bacteria from growing and making us sick.
5.1.5.4.1	Brushing your teeth in the morning and before going to bed is another important part of having good health.
5.1.5.4.2	Our teeth build up food throughout the day and overnight while we sleep.
5.1.5.4.3	Brushing our teeth removes the food and helps keep them strong.
5.1.5.5.1	Covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze is another way to prevent your germs from passing to someone else.
5.1.5.6.1	If you get a cut it must be cleaned to prevent any bacteria from creating an infection (disease).
5.1.5.6.2	After the wound is cleaned it should be covered with a bandage to reduce the chance of getting infected.
5.1.5.7.1	You have only one chance to live a healthy life style.
5.1.5.7.2	The best way to do this, in addition to eating healthfully, exercising, and getting rest is to avoid (do not take or try) harmful substances.
5.1.5.8.1	Smoking cigarettes, tobacco, or illegal drugs is very harmful to your body.
5.1.5.8.2	When a person smokes there are chemicals released by the tobacco that enter the lungs.
5.1.5.8.3	Because the lungs have to work harder to remove the chemicals, the body has to work harder to get the air needed to survive.
5.1.5.8.4	The chemicals from smoking can also cause very serious diseases such as lung cancer.
5.1.5.8.5	Smoking can also cause skin and teeth to turn an unhealthy color.
5.1.5.9.1	Drinking alcohol and/or taking illicit (not prescribed ) drugs are also very harmful to your body.
5.1.5.9.2	In order for alcohol and drugs to get out of your body the blood takes it to the liver, which is the organ that cleans the blood.
5.1.5.9.3	The liver has to work harder to remove these foreign substances.
5.1.5.9.4	As a result, your body may develop some serious illnesses.
5.1.5.10.1	Eating a balanced diet is one of the most important steps toward having good heath.
5.1.5.10.2	It is important to take in the proper foods and nutrients everyday so that your body. can grow, have energy, and repair itself.
5.1.5.10.3	A balanced diet includes:
5.1.5.11.1	Grains - bread, rice, pasta, cereal.
5.1.5.12.1	Vegetables - lettuce, broccoli, carrots, cucumbers.
5.1.5.13.1	Fruits - apples, bananas, oranges, grapes, pears.
5.1.5.14.1	Milk - cheese, yogurt, cream, dairy.
5.1.5.15.1	Meats and Beans - hamburger, chicken, eggs, tuna, nuts.
5.1.5.16.1	Oils and Sweets - butter, oil, sugars (in very limited amounts).
5.1.5.17.1	The MyPyramid is an easy way to plan the foods you are going to eat.
5.1.5.17.2	Each part of the pyramid represents the proper amounts of each type of food that will help you stay healthy.
5.1.5.17.3	Also, you should keep in mind that regular exercise is necessary to live a healthy lifestyle.
5.1.5.18.1	When we run, jump, walk, play sports, or ride our bike we are exercising.
5.1.5.18.2	Not only is it fun, but it is healthy for our bodies.
5.1.5.18.3	When we exercise our body is working hard and moving the nutrients, water, and air throughout our body.
5.1.5.19.1	Getting enough rest is also an important part of living a healthy life.
5.1.5.19.2	Our bodies need time to rest and recover from our busy day.
5.1.5.19.3	While we sleep our body gives the cells time to grow and repair.
5.1.5.19.4	When we get a good night's sleep we are able to better concentrate in school and find it easier to complete our work.
5.1.6.1.1	Ecology is the science that studies the relationships between organisms and their environments.
5.1.6.1.2	These interconnected relationships are called ecosystems.
5.1.6.1.3	An ecosystem is a community of all the living and nonliving parts of an environment.
5.1.6.2.1	Plants and animals depend on each other and the nonliving environment for survival.
5.1.6.2.2	Living things need specific resources for survival such as air, food, and water.
5.1.6.3.1	While plants are able to make their own food by photosynthesis they need sunlight and water to do so.
5.1.6.3.2	Plants also take in carbon dioxide from the environment and return oxygen to the air for animals to use.
5.1.6.3.3	Green plants are called producers because they provide the basic food supply for themselves and animals.
5.1.6.1.1.1	The sun is the ultimate source of energy for all life and physical cycles on Earth.
5.1.6.1.1.2	The sun's energy is transferred on Earth from plants to animals through the food chain.
5.1.6.1.2.1	Plants and animals interact in a number of ways that affect their survival.
5.1.6.1.2.2	The survival of plants and animals varies in response to t heir particular environment.
5.1.6.1.2.3	Provided there are enough resources for plants and animals they can survive in a successful (balanced) ecosystem community for long periods of time.
5.1.6.1.2.4	The U.S. National Park Service is committed to preserving, protecting, and sharing the beauty of successful ecosystems.
5.1.6.1.2.5	These protected areas are all over the United States in deserts, forests, prairies, tropical areas, and arctic regions.
5.1.6.1.3.1	Individuals in a species may compete with each other for food, mates, space, water, and shelter within their environment.
5.1.6.1.4.1	Problems arise when the balance between the organisms and the available resources and space changes.
5.1.6.1.4.2	Building homes, stores, factories, growing food crops, and pollution are some causes of ecosystem failure.
5.1.6.1.4.3	As the physical environment changes over time, plants and animals change and so do the relationships within the ecosystem.
5.1.6.1.5.1	An organism's pattern of behavior is related to the nature of that organism's environment.
5.1.6.1.5.2	This includes the kinds and numbers of other organisms present, the availability of food and other resources, and the physical characteristics of the environment.
5.1.6.1.6.1	Changes in the weather, too much rainfall, and severe cold or heat affect plants and animals.
5.1.6.1.6.2	When there are environmental changes, some plants and animals survive, reproduce, and increase in number, while others die or move to new locations.
5.1.6.1.6.3	This can have a major impact on the resources available.
5.1.6.1.6.4	There may not be enough food or shelter.
5.1.6.1.7.1	Another example of an environmental change would be when there is a natural disaster such as a flood or fire.
5.1.6.1.7.2	Some plants and animals are able to survive the changes while others may not.
5.1.6.2.1.1	Many things in our living environment go through cycles.
5.1.6.2.1.2	All animals depend on plants either as a direct source of food and energy or because plants are food for another animal that they eat.
5.1.6.2.1.3	Some animals (predators) eat other animals (prey).
5.1.6.2.1.4	In the photo below, the cat is considered a predator and the fish is its prey.
5.1.6.2.2.1	Animals that eat plants for food may in turn become food for other animals.
5.1.6.2.2.2	This sequence is called a food chain.
5.1.6.2.2.3	There are three terms used in a food chain:
5.1.6.2.3.1	Producers are living things that change the sun's energy to make their own food.
5.1.6.2.3.2	Green plants do this by photosynthesis.
5.1.6.2.4.1	Consumers are living things that feed on others.
5.1.6.2.5.1	A primary (1st) consumer eats producers (plants).
5.1.6.2.6.1	A secondary (2nd) consumer eats primary consumers.
5.1.6.2.7.1	A tertiary (3rd) consumer eats secondary consumers.
5.1.6.2.8.1	Decomposers are living things that break down dead organisms and recycle their nutrients into the soil.
5.1.6.2.8.2	They help in plant growth.
5.1.6.2.9.1	Some food chains crisscross and create a food web.
5.1.6.2.9.2	They can be simple:
5.1.7.1.1	Human decisions and activities have had a major impact on the physical and living environments.
5.1.7.2.1	Humans are dependent upon the environment for food, shelter, and energy.
5.1.7.2.2	Humans can live in many different environments.
5.1.7.2.3	Some people live in very cold regions.
5.1.7.2.4	Others live in tropical areas where it can get very warm.
5.1.7.2.5	Humans can live in areas with forests, prairies, deserts, or at the beach.
5.1.7.3.1	Humans use resources from the environment to create shelters and energy.
5.1.7.3.2	By using materials that are found naturally in the environment humans must be responsible and make sure that they do not create problems for nature.
5.1.7.3.3	Humans use wood to build homes, which comes from trees.
5.1.7.3.4	Cutting down too many trees has resulted in many forest animals no longer having homes.
5.1.7.4.1	Humans also use materials found in nature to create energy.
5.1.7.4.2	We use fossil fuels to make gasoline so that we can drive cars and trucks and fly planes.
5.1.7.4.3	Fossil fuels like oil and natural gas are used to heat our homes and power factories to make items that we purchase.
5.1.7.4.4	It can take thousands of years for certain fossil fuels to be created.
5.1.7.4.5	Humans must learn how to conserve our planet's natural resources.
5.1.7.5.1	Humans depend on natural and constructed environments.
5.1.7.5.2	The way that humans treat the environment has a large effect on the survival of all living and nonliving things.
5.1.7.6.1	As humans build homes, stores, and communities they displace the animals that live in those areas.
5.1.7.6.2	The animals have to move to new areas.
5.1.7.6.3	If they find new homes, the animals could have difficulty finding food, could be in danger of predators, or might not adapt to the new environment.
5.1.7.6.4	If they are unsuccessful in their new location, they may die.
5.1.7.6.5	If organisms in a species are not able to reproduce, that species may become extinct.
5.1.7.6.6	As humans construct new homes and buildings they change the landscape of the nonliving environment.
5.1.7.6.7	Floods can result from altering the flow of water in the environment.
5.1.7.7.1	Humans have also changed the environment by cultivating (growing) crops and raising animals.
5.1.7.7.2	Humans need food to survive and since the human population increases in size everyday there is a greater demand for food.
5.1.7.7.3	For there to be enough food, farmers plant and harvest grain, wheat, corn, fruits, and vegetables.
5.1.7.7.4	Animals are raised on farms for human consumption (to eat).
5.1.7.8.1	In addition to food, shelter, and energy, humans manufacture (produce) goods that make life more comfortable.
5.1.7.8.2	Factories are built and materials are taken from the environment to create many different products.
5.1.7.9.1	Humans developed various means of transportation so that they could live in one place and bring food, energy, and other goods to them rather than living at the site where they are made.
5.1.7.9.2	While it is nice to have cars, planes, and trains for transportation, these machines give off gases that are not helpful to the atmosphere.
5.1.7.10.1	Building shelters, using energy, manufacturing goods, and the various forms of transportation are some of the ways humans have created pollution.
5.1.7.10.2	Pollution is found in the air, on the land, and in the water.
5.1.7.11.1	Humans have changed their environment by developing communities in areas where living things had to struggle to survive.
5.1.7.11.2	When a new community is built in the desert, humans may bring in plants that are not familiar to that environment.
5.1.7.11.3	Watering their imported lawns increases the moisture in the dry air.
5.1.7.11.4	This can change the air quality and lead to pollution.
5.1.7.12.1	Humans can help the environment in many ways:
5.1.7.13.1	Feeding animals that have lost their natural resources due to the development of stores and homes.
5.1.7.14.1	Cleaning litter from beaches, parks, and forests.
5.1.7.15.1	Recycling and reusing papers, plastics, and metals to reduce the amount of waste in landfills.
5.1.7.16.1	Using appliances that conserve energy (energy efficient).
5.1.7.17.1	Creating new clean forms of energy to conserve fossil fuels.
5.2.1.1.1	Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space.
5.2.1.1.2	Mass is the amount of material present in an object.
5.2.1.1.3	To measure mass scientists use a balance.
5.2.1.1.4	Volume is defined as the amount of space an object takes up.
5.2.1.1.5	To measure liquid volume scientists use a graduated cylinder.
5.2.1.1.6	To measure the volume of a solid scientists use a ruler.
5.2.1.1.7	Think of this book.
5.2.1.1.8	It has mass as well as volume, therefore it is considered matter.
5.2.1.1.1.1	Matter exists in three phases: solid, liquid, and gas.
5.2.1.1.1.2	Solids have a definite shape and volume.
5.2.1.1.1.3	Liquids take the shape of the container they are placed in and have a definite volume.
5.2.1.1.1.4	Gases take the shape and volume of whatever container they occupy.
5.2.1.1.2.1	The simplest way to observe matter is to use your senses: sight, sound, taste, touch, and hearing.
5.2.1.1.2.2	In addition to their senses, scientists often use tools and/or instruments to observe matter.
5.2.1.1.2.3	Some tools include:
5.2.1.1.3.1	A ruler measures length.
5.2.1.1.4.1	A balance measures mass.
5.2.1.1.5.1	A thermometer measures temperature.
5.2.1.1.6.1	A graduated Cylinder measures volume.
5.2.1.2.1.1	Properties of matter can be considered physical or chemical.
5.2.1.2.2.1	Physical properties are those that can be observed and/or measured without changing the object.
5.2.1.2.2.2	Physical properties include: color, hardness, odor, sound, taste, texture, and size.
5.2.1.2.3.1	Chemical properties are those that involve a change in the object.
5.2.1.2.3.2	An example of a chemical property would be rusting.
5.2.1.2.1.1.1	Scientists often classify or organize different objects based on their physical properties.
5.2.1.3.1.1	Just as we can describe physical and chemical properties of matter we can describe the physical and chemical changes to matter.
5.2.1.3.2.1	Physical changes are those that involve changing one or more of the physical properties of matter.
5.2.1.3.2.2	Consider a piece of notebook paper.
5.2.1.3.2.3	What are some of the physical properties of the paper?
5.2.1.3.2.4	We can describe the paper in terms of its color (white) and its size (21 centimeters wide and 27 centimeters long).
5.2.1.3.3.1	How can we change the paper in order to give it different properties but still consider it to be paper?
5.2.1.3.3.2	We can rip the paper into little pieces.
5.2.1.3.3.3	We can color the paper using crayons or markers.
5.2.1.3.3.4	We can fold the paper into a smaller size.
5.2.1.3.4.1	Chemical changes involve changing the composition of an object, resulting in entirely different properties.
5.2.1.3.5.1	Consider again our piece of notebook paper.
5.2.1.3.5.2	We have seen how we can change a physical property of the paper, but still have it remain as paper.
5.2.1.3.6.1	How might we change the paper chemically?
5.2.1.3.6.2	One way to change the paper would be to burn it.
5.2.1.3.6.3	The white sheet of paper would become a pile of black ashes.
5.2.1.3.6.4	The ashes are chemically different from the paper so this is considered a chemical change.
5.2.2.1.1	Energy is the ability to do work.
5.2.2.1.2	Work involves the changing of an object's position, moving up and down or from side to side.
5.2.2.1.3	Without energy no work can be done.
5.2.2.1.4	Think about going a whole day at school without eating.
5.2.2.1.5	You would feel tired and not want to do anything.
5.2.2.1.6	It would be because you have no energy.
5.2.2.1.7	Energy for humans comes from the foods we eat.
5.2.2.1.8	Food is converted to energy so that we can work and play.
5.2.2.2.1	Energy can be classified in a number of ways.
5.2.2.2.2	An object could have potential energy, which is stored or kinetic energy, meaning that the object is in motion while using its energy.
5.2.2.2.3	A rock at the top of a hill that is standing still has potential energy.
5.2.2.2.4	If you give that rock a push and it begins to move down the hill, the potential energy is changed to kinetic energy, allowing the rock to move.
5.2.2.1.1.1	Energy exists in many forms.
5.2.2.1.1.2	Heat, electric, sound, chemical, mechanical, and light are all examples of different forms of energy.
5.2.2.1.2.1	Heat is the energy that gives us warmth.
5.2.2.1.2.2	We can get heat energy from the sun.
5.2.2.1.3.1	Electric energy is energy that allows us to turn on lights, ring door bells, and so on.
5.2.2.1.4.1	Sound is energy (noise) that we hear when matter vibrates and the particles in the matter hit each other.
5.2.2.1.5.1	Chemical energy is energy that is released when a chemical reaction takes place.
5.2.2.1.6.1	Mechanical energy is produced when two objects move together.
5.2.2.1.7.1	Light energy is energy that is given off from a light source such as the sun or a light bulb.
5.2.2.2.1.1	Energy can be transferred from one place to another and one object to another.
5.2.2.2.1.2	Have you ever put a metal spoon in a pot that is being heated on the stove and then tried to touch the spoon?
5.2.2.2.1.3	It gets hot.
5.2.2.2.1.4	The heat from the pot is transferred to the metal spoon.
5.2.2.2.1.5	If you were to put a wooden spoon in the same pot and then tried to touch it, the wooden spoon would not be hot.
5.2.2.2.1.6	Why?
5.2.2.2.1.7	Some materials transfer energy better than others.
5.2.2.2.1.8	Examples of some forms of energy transfer are:
5.2.2.2.2.1	Mechanical energy exerted by one object can push or pull another object.
5.2.2.2.3.1	Heat energy can be transferred from one object to another object.
5.2.2.2.4.1	Magnetism can be caused in some kinds of materials by a magnet.
5.2.2.2.5.1	Light can be reflected from one object to another.
5.2.2.2.6.1	Sound can be reflected from an object, causing an echo.
5.2.2.2.1.1.1	In everyday life different forms of energy interact with matter.
5.2.2.2.1.1.2	Much of this interaction results in energy changing from one form to another.
5.2.2.2.1.1.3	Examples of interactions and conversions (changes) include:
5.2.2.2.1.2.1	Light energy changes to electrical energy in a solar calculator.
5.2.2.2.1.3.1	Mechanical energy changes to sound energy by clapping your hands together.
5.2.2.2.1.4.1	Electrical energy changes to sound energy in a door buzzer.
5.2.2.2.1.5.1	Mechanical energy changes to sound energy by playing a musical instrument.
5.2.2.2.1.6.1	Chemical energy changes to electric energy in a battery.
5.2.2.2.1.7.1	Some other changes in energy include:
5.2.2.2.1.8.1	Mechanical energy changes to heat in bicycle brakes.
5.2.2.2.1.9.1	Mechanical energy changes to sound in a piano.
5.2.2.2.1.10.1	Heat changes to sound in a tea kettle.
5.2.2.2.1.11.1	Heat changes to light in a flame.
5.2.2.2.1.12.1	Electrical energy changes to mechanical energy in a food mixer.
5.2.2.2.1.13.1	Electrical energy changes to sound in a radio speaker.
5.2.2.2.1.14.1	Chemical energy changes to electrical energy in a battery.
5.2.2.2.1.15.1	Chemical energy changes to mechanical energy in a gasoline engine.
5.2.2.2.1.16.1	Magnetic energy changes to mechanical energy in a magnetic door latch.
5.2.2.2.1.17.1	Light changes to electrical energy in solar path lights.
5.2.2.2.1.18.1	Energy can move from one object to another through different materials and through space.
5.2.2.2.1.18.2	Some materials allow energy to be transferred more easily than others.
5.2.2.2.1.18.3	For example, some metal objects allow heat and electricity to transfer better than do plastic or rubber objects.
5.2.2.2.1.18.4	Iron and steel are more magnetic than wood or plastic.
5.2.2.2.1.18.5	Light energy travels in straight paths through space.
5.2.2.2.1.18.6	Light energy can move through glass much better than through paper.
5.2.2.3.1.1	Electricity is one form of energy.
5.2.2.3.1.2	Electrical energy results from positive and negative charges.
5.2.2.3.1.3	A complete circuit allows electrical energy to flow.
5.2.2.3.1.4	The amount of energy transferred during a flow of electrical energy depends on the energy source and the properties of the object.
5.2.2.3.2.1	Electricity powers many objects in our homes: television, radio, lights, computer, and other appliances.
5.2.2.3.2.2	Electricity travels in a path called a circuit.
5.2.2.3.2.3	A simple circuit generally involves a battery, or other source of electrons, wires through which the energy can flow, and the object that needs the energy to work, such as a light bulb.
5.2.2.3.2.4	The circuit or path must be complete in order for the object to work.
5.2.2.3.2.5	This is an example of a simple circuit:
5.2.2.3.3.1	One end of a wire is attached to a battery and the other end is attached to the base of the light bulb.
5.2.2.3.3.2	From the light bulb there is another wire that runs back to the battery.
5.2.2.3.3.3	When all the wires are attached, the bulb will give off light.
5.2.2.3.3.4	When one of the wires is not attached, as in the diagram below, the circuit will not be complete and the bulb will not give off light.
5.2.3.1.1	A force is a push or pull.
5.2.3.1.2	A force is what makes it possible to change the position of an object.
5.2.3.1.3	A force can also be used to change the direction that an object is moving.
5.2.3.1.4	The amount of force put on an object will determine how far and fast the object will move.
5.2.3.2.1	The weight of the object will also effect how far and fast it will move.
5.2.3.2.2	Think about moving a box across a wood floor.
5.2.3.2.3	If the box were empty and you gave it a push it would easily move across the floor.
5.2.3.2.4	If the same box were full of marbles you would need more force to move it across the floor.
5.2.3.3.1	Friction is a force that provides resistance whenever two surfaces are in contact.
5.2.3.3.2	The box pushed across the floor will eventually stop because of the force, or friction, the floor has on the box.
5.2.3.3.3	The amount of friction that an object encounters depends on its smoothness.
5.2.3.3.4	The smoother the surface, the less friction against an object, so the faster it will move.
5.2.3.3.5	Skiers and surfers often apply wax to their skis and boards in order to make them smoother so they will glide along the surface of the snow or water faster.
5.2.3.4.1	Friction is also the force exerted by brakes on a bicycle or car in order to stop.
5.2.3.4.2	Take the same box from the previous diagram.
5.2.3.4.3	What would happen if we were to try and push the box along the sand?
5.2.3.1.1.1	Another type of force is magnetism.
5.2.3.1.1.2	A magnet is an object that attracts metals.
5.2.3.1.1.3	The magnet works because the forces in it are all moving in the same direction, resulting in two different poles (ends).
5.2.3.1.1.4	The space around the magnet is called the magnetic field.
5.2.3.1.1.5	If you were to place a magnet under a piece of paper and sprinkle iron filings on the paper you would be able to see the magnetic field of the magnet.
5.2.3.1.2.1	The different poles of a magnet are attracted to one another.
5.2.3.1.2.2	The poles are labeled north and south.
5.2.3.1.2.3	If you were to take two magnets, the north end of one magnet would be attracted to the south end of the other.
5.2.3.1.3.1	If, however, you were to try and put the two north ends of two different magnets together you would feel the force that causes the magnets to be repelled (pushed away) from one another.
5.2.3.1.4.1	The distance between two magnets or a magnet and another metal object has an effect on the force of attraction.
5.2.3.1.4.2	The smaller the distance between the objects, the greater the force of attraction.
5.2.3.1.4.3	As the distance between the objects increases the magnetic force of attraction decreases.
5.2.3.2.1.1	Gravity is also a force that acts on objects here on Earth.
5.2.3.2.1.2	Gravity is the force that pulls an object toward the center of the Earth.
5.2.3.2.1.3	It is gravity that keeps everything from flying away.
5.2.3.2.1.4	If an object is thrown into the air, the force used will only allow it to travel a certain distance before the gravitational attraction between the object and the Earth causes it to fall back down to Earth 's surface.
5.2.3.3.1.1	In the previous chapter we learned about work and energy.
5.2.3.3.1.2	Mechanical energy is the energy produced when two objects move together.
5.2.3.3.1.3	We have also learned that in order to do work an object must move and that a force is a push or pull.
5.2.3.3.1.4	In our everyday lives we exert force to do work.
5.2.3.3.1.5	Often the force we need in order to do the work is too much for one person and we need help.
5.2.3.3.1.6	When this happens we use tools, or machines, to help us do work.
5.2.3.3.1.7	Simple machines are tools with very few parts that help us work.
5.2.3.3.1.8	There are a variety of simple machines:
5.2.3.3.2.1	A lever is a flat structure that is placed on a fixed point.
5.2.3.3.2.2	The lever can assist in moving an object that is too heavy such as a big weight, or can assist in opening an object such as a paint can.
5.2.3.3.2.3	The seesaw in a playground is also considered a lever.
5.2.3.3.3.1	An inclined plane is a ramp that extends from one level to another.
5.2.3.3.3.2	A wheelchair ramp into your school is an example of an inclined plane.
5.2.3.3.4.1	A pulley is composed of a wheel with a piece of rope or chain around it.
5.2.3.3.4.2	Pulleys are used to lift objects.
5.2.3.3.4.3	By pulling down on one end the opposite end is raised.
5.2.3.3.4.4	A pulley is used to raise the flag up the flagpole at your school each day.
5.2.3.3.5.1	Pulling down on the rope at side A will cause the box on the end of the rope at side B to be raised.
5.2.3.3.6.1	A wheel and axle involves a wheel turning on a straight bar or axle.
5.2.3.3.6.2	Examples of this type of machine are a door knob and the wheel on a wheelbarrow.
5.2.3.3.7.1	A wedge is a type of inclined plane that can be forced into another object.
5.2.3.3.7.2	The blade of an ax is considered to be a wedge.
5.2.3.3.8.1	A screw is another type of inclined plane that is wrapped around a cylinder.
5.2.3.3.8.2	By turning the screw you insert it into another object.
5.2.4.1.1	There are a number of different objects, called celestial objects, that appear in the sky each day and night.
5.2.4.1.2	The sun, stars, moon, planets, and comets are all celestial objects.
5.2.4.1.3	The apparent movement of these objects gives us an indication of the passage of time.
5.2.4.1.4	The sun, moon, and certain stars can be seen every day and night in our sky.
5.2.4.1.5	We see different planets throughout the year because of the motion of the Earth and the movement of the planets around the sun.
5.2.4.1.1.1	The sun is considered the center of our solar system and all objects move around the sun.
5.2.4.1.1.2	But the sun appears to "rise" and "set" each day.
5.2.4.1.1.3	This is not because of the motion of the sun but rather the motion of the Earth.
5.2.4.1.1.4	The Earth rotates, or spins, on its axis once every 24 hours.
5.2.4.1.1.5	This rotation is what results in day and night on Earth.
5.2.4.1.1.6	It is the rotation of the Earth that makes the sun appear to move through the sky during the day, rising in the east and setting in the west.
5.2.4.1.2.1	We measure time on Earth based on both the rotation of the Earth on its axis and its revolution around the sun.
5.2.4.1.2.2	The passage of time in different units is based on the smallest unit being a second.
5.2.4.1.3.1	1 minute equals 60 seconds.
5.2.4.1.4.1	1 hour equals 60 minutes.
5.2.4.1.5.1	1 day equals 24 hours.
5.2.4.1.6.1	1 month equals approximately 30 or 31 days.
5.2.4.1.7.1	1 year equals 12 months or 365 days.
5.2.4.1.8.1	As the Earth revolves around the sun, its position changes and the amount of sunlight received by Earth also changes.
5.2.4.1.8.2	The Earth is divided into two halves or hemispheres, the equator being the dividing line.
5.2.4.1.8.3	Anything north of the equator is in the northern hemisphere and anything south of the equator is in the southern hemisphere.
5.2.4.1.9.1	The Earth is tilted on its axis.
5.2.4.1.9.2	As a result, one part of the Earth is always pointed toward the sun.
5.2.4.1.9.3	Because of the tilt and the Earth's position around the sun during its revolution the Earth experiences four distinct seasons: winter, spring, summer, and fall.
5.2.4.1.9.4	In the northern hemisphere, where New York State is located, the seasons are divided as follows:
5.2.4.1.10.1	Winter lasts from December 22 to March 19.
5.2.4.1.11.1	Spring lasts from March 20 to June 19.
5.2.4.1.12.1	Summer lasts from June 20 to September 21.
5.2.4.1.13.1	Fall lasts from September 22 to December 22.
5.2.4.1.14.1	Each season has its distinct weather conditions, which will be discussed in the next chapter.
5.2.4.2.1.1	The moon is a satellite of the Earth.
5.2.4.2.1.2	This means that the moon orbits (moves around) the Earth in a path.
5.2.4.2.1.3	The movement of the moon around the Earth is called revolution.
5.2.4.2.1.4	The moon does not give off its own light.
5.2.4.2.1.5	We see the moon in the sky because it reflects light from the sun.
5.2.4.2.1.6	Half of the moon's surface is continually lit by reflected sunlight.
5.2.4.2.1.7	The moon makes a complete orbit around the Earth once every 29 1/2 days.
5.2.4.2.1.8	This means that it takes approximately one month for the moon to completely revolve around the Earth.
5.2.4.2.1.9	Because of the moon's movement and the reflected light from the sun we see different portions of the moon at different times during the 29 1/2 days.
5.2.4.2.1.10	The different portions of the moon that we see are called phases.
5.2.4.2.1.11	There are five phases of the moon:
5.2.4.2.2.1	Full - a complete circle of the moon is visible.
5.2.4.2.3.1	Gibbous - almost a complete circle of the moon is visible.
5.2.4.2.4.1	Quarter - half a circle of the moon is visible.
5.2.4.2.5.1	Crescent - only a small portion of the moon is visible.
5.2.4.2.6.1	New - the moon is not visible at all.
5.2.4.2.7.1	Because the moon and Earth are constantly moving it is possible for each to move into the shadow created by the other.
5.2.4.2.7.2	When one celestial body moves into the shadow of another the event is known as an eclipse.
5.2.4.2.7.3	There are two types of eclipses involving the sun, moon, and Earth.
5.2.4.2.8.1	A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes between the sun and a full moon.
5.2.4.2.8.2	During a lunar eclipse, the moon appears to be a reddish-orange color when viewed from Earth.
5.2.4.2.9.1	A solar eclipse occurs when the moon comes between the sun and the Earth.
5.2.4.2.9.2	Solar eclipses occur during new moons.
5.2.4.2.9.3	The moon blocks the sun's light from reaching Earth.
5.2.4.2.9.4	The sky appears to darken as it moves in front of the sun and then lightens as the moon moves away.
5.2.5.1.1	Weather describes the conditions in the sky on any particular day.
5.2.5.1.2	Climate describes the weather conditions in an area over time.
5.2.5.1.3	Weather observations are made using human senses as well a variety of instruments.
5.2.5.1.4	Some weather instruments include:
5.2.5.2.1	A barometer measures air pressure.
5.2.5.3.1	An anemometer measures wind speed.
5.2.5.4.1	A rain gauge measures rainfall.
5.2.5.5.1	A thermometer measures temperature.
5.2.5.6.1	Air pressure is the pressure against the surface of the Earth by the atmosphere.
5.2.5.6.2	Differences in air pressure over the surface of the Earth result in wind.
5.2.5.6.3	The greater the differences in air pressures, the stronger the wind.
5.2.5.6.4	Air pressure is measured with a barometer.
5.2.5.7.1	Scientists use an anemometer to determine wind speed.
5.2.5.7.2	Wind speed is usually measured in miles per hour.
5.2.5.7.3	A gentle breeze might be measured at a speed of 2 miles per hour whereas the winds from a hurricane could be measured at 100 miles per hour.
5.2.5.7.4	Wind direction is also important because it can indicate the temperature and moisture level of the wind.
5.2.5.7.5	A southwest wind would bring warm air to New York from the south, but a northeast wind would most likely bring cold, wet winds.
5.2.5.8.1	A rain gauge is used to measure rainfall.
5.2.5.8.2	The amount of rain that falls can be important in areas that need rainwater for everyday use, especially farmers who need rainwater for their crops.
5.2.5.8.3	Rainfall amounts are usually measured in inches.
5.2.5.8.4	The rate at which rain falls can be measured in inches per hour.
5.2.5.9.1	Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold the air is.
5.2.5.9.2	A thermometer is the instrument used to measure temperature.
5.2.5.9.3	Temperature is measured in degrees on either the Fahrenheit or Celsius scale.
5.2.5.10.1	The information provided by these weather instruments is very useful in determining current or future weather conditions.
5.2.5.11.1	Precipitation is the term used to describe water (moisture) that falls from the sky.
5.2.5.11.2	Different forms of precipitation include:
5.2.5.12.1	Rain is liquid water falling from the sky.
5.2.5.13.1	Sleet is freezing rain falling from the sky.
5.2.5.14.1	Snow is solid water falling from the sky.
5.2.5.15.1	Hail is solid balls of water and dust falling from the sky.
5.2.5.16.1	Sleet and snow are more common in the winter months when the temperature is cold enough to freeze water.
5.2.5.16.2	Hail is commonly associated with thunderstorms in the spring and summer.
5.2.5.16.3	Rain can occur anytime during the year as long as the outside temperature is above the freezing point of water.
5.2.5.16.4	Once the outside temperature drops below the freezing point of water it is more likely that the precipitation will be in the form of snow.
5.2.5.17.1	Other conditions used to describe the weather include humidity and cloud cover.
5.2.5.17.2	Humidity is the amount of moisture in the atmosphere.
5.2.5.17.3	When the humidity reaches 100 percent it is very likely that some form of precipitation will occur, depending on the temperature.
5.2.5.17.4	Clouds form when water in the atmosphere condenses on dust particles suspended in the air.
5.2.5.17.5	Different clouds are associated with different weather conditions.
5.2.5.17.6	Clouds can block the Earth's ability to absorb light and heat from the sun and therefore can affect temperature.
5.2.5.18.1	A meteorologist is a scientist who uses the information from weather instruments to predict weather.
5.2.5.18.2	Have you ever watched the news and seen the weatherperson in front of a map explaining the weather?
5.2.5.18.3	He or she usually gives the temperature, sky conditions, and precipitation.
5.2.5.18.4	He or she can also make predictions as to what might happen the next day.
5.2.5.18.5	Weatherpersons use the simple instruments already discussed as well as information provided by satellites and computer models.
5.2.5.1.1.1	There are a number of conditions that will result in specific types of storms.
5.2.5.1.1.2	Some of these include:
5.2.5.1.2.1	Hurricanes usually occur between June and November.
5.2.5.1.3.1	Hurricanes have very high winds, over 74 miles per hour, and rain.
5.2.5.1.4.1	Hurricanes develop in the Atlantic Ocean.
5.2.5.1.5.1	A hurricane can exist for many days as it moves across water and land.
5.2.5.1.6.1	Tornados can happen at any time of the year.
5.2.5.1.7.1	Tornados are most common in spring and summer.
5.2.5.1.8.1	Tornados usually develop over land.
5.2.5.1.9.1	Tornados have very short lives, seconds to minutes.
5.2.5.1.10.1	Most severe thunderstorms occur in summer when air is hot and moist.
5.2.5.1.11.1	Lightning, hail, and tornados are associated with severe thunderstorms.
5.2.5.1.12.1	Floods can occur during periods of heavy rain.
5.2.5.1.13.1	If the ground is too hard or full of water, or it rains for a long period of time, the ground cannot soak up the water.
5.2.5.1.14.1	Droughts occur in areas where there has been little or no rain for a long period of time.
5.2.5.1.15.1	These storms/conditions can have a harmful effect on the areas involved.
5.2.5.1.15.2	Buildings can be damaged.
5.2.5.1.15.3	Crops and vegetation can be damaged or destroyed.
5.2.5.1.15.4	Humans and animals can be displaced from their homes and injured.
5.2.5.2.1.1	Each season that occurs in New York state experiences specific climate conditions.
5.2.5.2.2.1	The amount of daylight hours increases throughout Spring.
5.2.5.2.3.1	During Spring, the temperature starts out cold and gradually warms.
5.2.5.2.4.1	Spring has high amounts of rainfall.
5.2.5.2.5.1	The longest period of daylight hours occurs at the beginning of Summer.
5.2.5.2.6.1	During Summer, temperatures get warmer through the month of August.
5.2.5.2.7.1	The amount of daylight hours decreases throughout Fall.
5.2.5.2.8.1	Temperatures gradually decrease throughout Fall.
5.2.5.2.9.1	The shortest period of daylight hours occurs at the beginning of Winter.
5.2.5.2.10.1	Temperatures get colder throughout Winter.
5.2.5.2.11.1	Because of the tilt and position of the Earth around the sun at different times of the year the two hemispheres experience opposite seasons.
5.2.5.2.11.2	For example, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere the southern hemisphere experiences summer.
5.2.6.1.1	Water is a substance that is found all over the Earth: in the ground, on the surface, and in the air.
5.2.6.1.2	Water exists in three phases: solid, liquid, and gas.
5.2.6.2.1	Water in the solid phase is often called ice.
5.2.6.2.2	Water in the liquid phase is called water.
5.2.6.2.3	Water in the gaseous phase is often called water vapor or steam.
5.2.6.3.1	Water can easily be changed from one phase to another by the addition or removal of heat.
5.2.6.3.2	Each phase change that water goes through has a specific name.
5.2.6.4.1	Freezing involves changing water from its liquid state to its solid state (ice) by the removal of heat.
5.2.6.5.1	Melting is the opposite of freezing and involves changing water from its solid state (ice) to a liquid state by the addition of heat.
5.2.6.6.1	Evaporation involves changing water from its liquid state to a gaseous state (vapor).
5.2.6.6.2	Imagine the puddles that form on your street after a heavy rain.
5.2.6.6.3	After a few hours or days those puddles disappear.
5.2.6.6.4	Where did they go?
5.2.6.6.5	The energy from the sun heated the water and caused it to evaporate - change from liquid water to water vapor.
5.2.6.6.6	The water vapor then entered the air.
5.2.6.7.1	Condensation involves changing water from its gaseous state (vapor) to its liquid state.
5.2.6.7.2	Think back to a hot summer day, when you poured yourself a glass of cold water and took it outside.
5.2.6.7.3	After a few minutes water droplets appeared on the outside of your glass.
5.2.6.7.4	This is because the water vapor in the air came in contact with the cool glass.
5.2.6.7.5	The water vapor cooled and changed from its gaseous state to a liquid state (droplets) on your glass.
5.2.6.8.1	Precipitation is often defined as water falling from the sky.
5.2.6.8.2	The water that falls can be in liquid form, such as rain, or in solid form, such as snow.
5.2.6.8.3	Examples of precipitation include rain, snow, sleet, and hail.
5.2.6.9.1	The movement of water between the ground, surface, and air is referred to as the water cycle.
5.2.6.10.1	Water found on the surface of the Earth is referred to as surface water.
5.2.6.10.2	Surface water can be fresh, such as water found in lakes and rivers, or salt, such as water found in oceans or seas.
5.2.6.10.3	When precipitation falls to the Earth the water is eventually absorbed (taken in) by the ground.
5.2.6.10.4	Sometimes the precipitation happens too quickly and the ground cannot absorb all of the water.
5.2.6.10.5	As a result, the water moves across the surface of the ground.
5.2.6.10.6	Water flowing on the Earth's surface is referred to as runoff.
5.2.6.10.7	When the ground absorbs the water and it settles below the surface it is called groundwater.
5.2.7.1.1	Weathering, erosion, and deposition result from the interactions between air, land, and water.
5.2.7.1.2	The processes of weathering and erosion change the landscape of the Earth on a daily basis.
5.2.7.1.3	Weathering is a process that breaks rocks and other surface materials into small pieces.
5.2.7.1.4	This can be done through the action of different forces including water and plant life.
5.2.7.2.1	Water exists in many phases.
5.2.7.2.2	Water in the liquid phase often sinks into the cracks between rocks.
5.2.7.2.3	When the water freezes, it expands, making the crack even larger, and in some cases, breaks the rock.
5.2.7.2.4	This process continues over long periods of time, breaking down rocks.
5.2.7.2.5	Plants can also break down rocks by the action of their roots, which are constantly growing to secure the plant and seek water.
5.2.7.3.1	As the rocks break, they can be further broken down through continued weathering, eventually becoming very small pieces that combine with other Earth materials to create soil.
5.2.7.3.2	Soil is composed of pieces of Earth materials, both living and nonliving.
5.2.7.4.1	Weathering of rock and landforms can also take place through the action of running water and waves.
5.2.7.4.2	The flow of water through a landform can create valleys in large rocks.

5.2.7.4.4	The force of waves breaking on beaches and cliffs can also change landforms.
5.2.7.5.1	Erosion is the process by which soil and or other Earth materials are moved from one place to another.
5.2.7.5.2	Water, wind, and gravity are all forces involved in erosion.
5.2.7.5.3	Examples of erosion include:
5.2.7.6.1	movement of sand along a beach by wave action

5.2.7.9.1	Increased water flow can widen a riverbed.
5.2.7.10.1	The processes of weathering and erosion work together over time.
5.2.7.10.2	Rocks are weathered, broken down, and then carried away through the action of erosion.
5.2.7.10.3	Eventually, the particles that are being moved by water, wind, and/or gravity will stop moving.
5.2.7.10.4	Deposition occurs when the particles stop moving.
5.2.7.1.1.1	Earthquakes are caused by the shifting of the plates that make up the Earth's crust.
5.2.7.1.1.2	Earthquakes occur every day all over Earth.
5.2.7.1.1.3	Most of the time people do not feel the earthquakes.
5.2.7.1.1.4	However, powerful earthquakes can cause damage to landscapes and buildings.
